	<h4><li>Service Connects Beekeepers and Worker Bees</li></h4>
	<div>The Service is a communications platform for enabling the connection between individuals and/or businesses seeking to obtain task services ("Beekeepers") and/or individuals seeking to provide task services ("Worker Bees"). Beekeepers and Worker Bees together are hereinafter referred to as "Users." Those certain task services requested by the Beekeepers, which are to be completed by the Worker Bees are hereinafter referred to as "Tasks."</div>
	<br>
	
	<h4><li>Company Only Provides a Venue</li></h4>
	<div>The Service a communications platform for enabling connections between Users. Company does not take part in the interaction between Users. Company does not have control over the quality, timing, legality, failure to provide, or any other aspect whatsoever of any ratings provided by Users, Tasks provided by Beekeepers, nor of the integrity, responsibility or any of the actions or omissions whatsoever of any Users. Company does not have control over the quality, timing or legality of Tasks delivered by its Worker Bees. Company makes no representations about the suitability, reliability, timeliness, or accuracy of the Tasks requested and provided by Users identified through the Service whether in public, private, or offline interactions. Although Company may perform background checks of Worker Bees, as outlined in more detail below, Company cannot confirm that each User is who they claim to be. Company does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy or reliability of this information or any information provided through the Service.</div>
	<br>
	<div>Company does screen the Worker Bees via personal interviews. However, when interacting with other Users you should exercise caution and common sense to protect your personal safety and property, just as you would when interacting with other persons whom you don't know. NEITHER COMPANY NOR ITS AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT, WHETHER ONLINE OR OFFLINE, OF ANY USER OF THE SERVICE. COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, INJURY OR DAMAGE ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE.</div>
	<br>
	
	<h4><li>Transactions</li></h4>
	<div>Users of the Service contract for Tasks directly with other Users. Company will not be a party to any contracts for Tasks or services. Company facilitates these contracts by supplying a medium for the exchange of money. Payment will be processed at the end of a completed Task transaction. Beekeepers offer payments for each requested Task (such payment, a "Honeycomb"). When a Task is marked as closed by the Beekeeper, the agreed upon Honeycomb will be transferred to the Worker Bee's online account. When the Task is marked complete by the Worker Bee, which is an optional action, the Beekeeper will have three (3) days before the Task is automatically marked complete in the system database and the Worker Bee is paid the agreed upon Honeycomb. The Honeycomb must be paid through the Service. Any Honeycombs paid in cash outside of the Service are NOT subject to refunds. Any reimbursement expenses that are incurred by a Worker Bee in connection with the completion of a Task may, however, be paid in cash offline or through the Service.</div>
	<br>
	
	<h4><li>Billing and Payment Policy</li></h4>
	<div>For all purchases and payments for reimbursement costs, fees or expenses associated with a Task, Company will charge your credit card according to the amount agreed upon between you and Company for the use of the Service, and you hereby authorize us to charge your credit card for such amounts. Company retains the right, in its sole discretion, to place a hold on any payment for a completed Task transaction.</div>
	<br>
	<div>Company has no obligation to provide refunds or credits, but may grant them in extenuating circumstances, as a result of specific refund guarantee promotions, or to correct any errors made by Company, in each case in Company's sole discretion.</div>
	<br>
	<div>You will be liable for all transaction taxes on the services provided under this Agreement (other than taxes based on Company's income).</div>
	<br>
	<div>Company may use Stripe ("Stripe") for payment processing. In order for The Hired Hive to use Stripe's payment processing services, The Hired Hive must enter into the Terms of Service (the "TOS") with Stripe and its sponsoring bank. The TOS is available here. By accepting these Terms of Use, The Hired Hive agrees: (a) that The Hired Hive has downloaded or printed the TOS, and (b) that The Hired Hive has reviewed and agrees to the TOS. Please note that the Company is not a party to the TOS and that you, Stripe and Stripe's sponsoring bank are the three parties to the TOS and that the Company has no obligations or liability to The Hired Hive under the TOS. If you have questions regarding the TOS, please contact Stripe at info@stripe.com.</div>
	<br>
	
	<h4><li>Payment Accounts</li></h4>
	<div>Each Beekeeper must properly discharge and credit its Worker Bee for all payments Company receives from such Beekeeper. Each User understands and agrees that:</div>
	<ul>
		<li>The transmission of funds in the manner described herein is not a separate and discrete service that Company provides in addition to the Service. Rather, the transmission of funds in an auditable manner is an integral part of the Service that Company provides.</li>
		<li>Each User's payment account is a custodial account administered by Company to facilitate disbursement of each Beekeeper's payment to each Worker Bee.</li>
		<li>Company acts as agent of each User and not as a trustee or fiduciary with respect to payments received through Company.
Company holds funds delivered to it in a commingled account at a bank (each, a "Pooled Account"), and may include in the titling of a Pooled Account "Company, for the benefit of others" or similar words. Company maintains records at Company that should, in the event of a bank failure, allow the FDIC to determine which funds are payable to which Worker Bees.
Company will not voluntarily make your funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy.</li>
		<li>You agree that Company has sole discretion over the establishment and maintenance of any Pooled Account. You agree that you will not receive interest or other earnings on the funds that Company handles as your agent and places in a Pooled Account. In consideration for your use of the Service, you irrevocably transfer and assign to Company any ownership right that you may have in any interest that may accrue on funds held in a Pooled Account. This assignment applies only to interest earned on your funds, and nothing in this Agreement grants Company any ownership right to the principal of the funds you maintain with Company. In addition to or instead of earning interest on Pooled Accounts, Company may receive a reduction in fees or expense charged for banking services by the banks that hold your funds.</li></ul>
		<br>

	<h4><li>Release</li></h4>
	<div>The Service is only a venue for connecting Users. Because Company is not involved in the actual contact between Users or in the completion of the Task, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more Users, you release Company (and our officers, directors, agents, investors, subsidiaries, and employees) from any and all claims, demands, or damages (actual or consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.</div><br>
<div>Company expressly disclaims any liability that may arise between Users of its Service.</div>
<br>

Such informal negotiations will commence upon written notice. Your address for such notices is your billing address, with an email copy to the email address you have provided to Company.</div><br>
	<div>BINDING ARBITRATION.

Any election to arbitrate by one party will be final and binding on the other. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IF EITHER PARTY ELECTS TO ARBITRATE, NEITHER PARTY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration will be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and, where appropriate, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be governed by the AAA Rules (and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules). If your claim for damages does not exceed $5,000, Company will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you and Company may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</div><br>
	<div>EXCEPTIONS TO ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION.

If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this "Dispute Resolution" Section will be deemed null and void.</div><br>
	<div>LOCATION OF ARBITRATION. Arbitration will take place in Wake County, North Carolina.
